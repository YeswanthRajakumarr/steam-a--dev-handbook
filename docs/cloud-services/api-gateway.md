# API Gateway

1. #### API Design Best Practices:

- Design RESTful APIs following industry best practices and standards.
- Use descriptive resource URIs and HTTP methods for intuitive API endpoints.
- Implement proper error handling and status code responses for different scenarios.

2. #### Security and Authorization:

- Implement API Gateway authentication and authorization mechanisms using AWS Cognito, IAM, or custom authorizers.
- Apply API key or IAM role-based access controls to restrict access to your APIs.

3. #### Monitoring and Analytics:

- Enable API Gateway logging to CloudWatch Logs for monitoring and auditing API requests and responses.
- Use API Gateway metrics and CloudWatch Alarms to monitor API usage, latency, and errors.
