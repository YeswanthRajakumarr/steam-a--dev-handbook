# Lambda

1. #### Function Design and Architecture:

- Design Lambda functions with a single responsibility to promote modularity and reusability.
- Keep Lambda functions stateless and idempotent for scalability and fault tolerance.
- Use environment variables for configuration and external dependencies to decouple the function logic from its environment.

2. #### Optimization and Performance:

- Optimize Lambda function performance by minimizing cold starts and maximizing resource utilization.
- Use provisioned concurrency to pre-warm Lambda functions for consistent performance.
- Implement function timeouts, retries, and error handling strategies to handle transient failures gracefully.

3. #### Integration and Triggers:

- Integrate Lambda functions with various AWS services like API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB, SQS, etc., using event sources.
- Leverage Lambda triggers to automate workflows and respond to events in real-time.
