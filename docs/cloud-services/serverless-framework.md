# Serverless Application Model

1. #### Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
 -  Define serverless applications and resources using YAML or JSON templates.
 -  Use SAM or Serverless Framework for managing and deploying serverless applications with
version-controlled configuration.
2. #### Local Development and Testing:
 -  Emulate AWS services locally for development and testing using SAM Local or Serverless Offline.
 -  Write unit tests and integration tests for Lambda functions and API Gateway endpoints.
3. #### Deployment and Continuous Integration (CI/CD):
 -  Automate deployment pipelines using CI/CD tools like AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions.
 -  Use SAM or Serverless Framework plugins to package and deploy serverless applications to AWS environments.
